[API](./markdown/API.md).
```

````

*nuance* uses linear models and gaussian processes (using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)-based [tinygp](https://github.com/dfm/tinygp)) to simultaneously **search for planetary transits while modeling correlated noises** (e.g. stellar variability) in a tractable way.
